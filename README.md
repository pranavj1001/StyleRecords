# StyleRecords
An electron mongodb app which stores notes in md format.

Hey there,

This is an electron application which stores notes in md format. It uses mongodb for storing the data. It has a custom search engine which makes searching a lot easy. Apart from this, it also has the functionality to edit, delete, view and add new notes.

This repository can also be used as a reference for using electron with mongodb. Its a great combination in my opinion since everything is written in javascript.
